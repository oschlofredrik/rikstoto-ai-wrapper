# Hugging Face Inference API Issue - 404 Errors

## Current Status (August 2025)

All models are returning **404 Not Found** errors when accessed via the Hugging Face Inference API, even with valid authentication tokens.

## Issue Details

### What We've Tried
1. ✅ **Token Verification** - Token format is correct (`hf_xxxxxxx`)
2. ✅ **Multiple Models Tested** - All return 404:
   - gpt2
   - distilgpt2
   - EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m
   - bigscience/bloom-560m
   - google/flan-t5-small
   - gpt2-medium

3. ✅ **Different Access Methods**:
   - Direct HTTP requests with curl
   - Python requests library
   - Official huggingface-hub Python client
   - All methods return the same 404 error

### Error Pattern
```
Without auth: 401 - Invalid username or password
With auth: 404 - Not Found
```

This suggests the authentication is working, but the models aren't accessible.

## Possible Causes

1. **Token Permissions Issue**
   - The token might need specific permissions for Inference API access
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens to check/create a new token
   - Ensure "Make calls to the serverless Inference API" is enabled

2. **API Changes**
   - Hugging Face may have changed their Inference API structure
   - Some models might have been moved to paid tiers only

3. **Regional Restrictions**
   - The Inference API might have regional limitations

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Create a New Token
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Create a new token with these permissions:
   - ✅ Read access to public gated repos
   - ✅ Make calls to the serverless Inference API
3. Update `.env` file with new token

### 2. Use Inference Endpoints (Paid)
Instead of the free Inference API, use dedicated Inference Endpoints:
- https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints
- Provides dedicated infrastructure
- Guaranteed availability

### 3. Use Local Models
Install and run models locally using transformers:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')
result = generator("Hello, I'm a language model", max_length=30)
```

### 4. Use Alternative APIs
Consider using:
- OpenAI API
- Anthropic Claude API
- Google Gemini API
- Cohere API

## Temporary Workaround

Until the Inference API issue is resolved, the application includes:
1. Clear error messages when models fail
2. Retry logic for 503 (loading) responses
3. Test endpoint at `/test-models` to check model availability

## Monitoring

Check current status:
- Visit http://localhost:8000/test-models to see which models work
- Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for API documentation
- Check https://status.huggingface.co/ for Hugging Face service status

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Token Permissions**
   - Create a new token with all inference permissions
   - Test with the new token

2. **Contact Hugging Face Support**
   - Report the issue if it persists
   - Check their forums for similar issues

3. **Consider Alternatives**
   - Implement fallback to local models
   - Add support for other AI APIs
   - Use Inference Endpoints for production
